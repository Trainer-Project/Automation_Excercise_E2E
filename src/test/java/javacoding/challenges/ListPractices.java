	// What is the collection?
	// Ans:- The collection in java a framework that an architecture to store and
	// manipulate the group of object

	// Differences between collection, Collections & Collectors
	// Collection -> The Collection is an interface to store and manipulate the
	// group of the object

	// Collections -> Collections is a utility class in java, Help with with
	// collections we can
	// reverse the string/number of value, find out max, min value as well as many
	// more operations

	// Collectors -> collectors is final class that extend the object class,Help
	// of collector we can remove the duplicate value & many more

	// What is the List?
	// List is an interface
	// List implements many class like (ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector & stack)

	// ArrayList advantage
	// ArrayList support dynamic arrays that can grow as needed
	// ArrayList allows duplicate elements and null values as well
	// ArrayList class maintain the insertion order
	// ArrayList is non-synchronized, That means it's faster
	// ArrayList flowing the index theory java
	// ArrayList when add the new values increases the size 50%
	// ArrayList faster then vector
	// ArrayList slower then array
	
	// Array length is fixed
	// Array is an object as well non-primitive data type
	// Array is faster 
	// Single diminution & multi-diminution array
